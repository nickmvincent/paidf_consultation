# Public AI Data Flywheel — User FAQ

This FAQ explains what the data flywheel is, why you might contribute, and how your choices affect privacy, attribution, and downstream use. It is written for people using the OpenWebUI chat at https://chat.publicai.co/.

## TL;DR: Data Options (Initial Launch)

- Private/Temporary: Use temporary chats or delete chats yourself. Nothing is shared outside the app; stored minimally; you control deletion.
- Aggregate‑Only (default): Chats stay private, but we compute de‑identified aggregate stats (e.g., usage counts, broad trends). Nothing is shared outside the app.
- Public Contributions (opt‑in per chat): You select specific chats to publish to a public dataset (via PR), choose a license, and attach AI‑use preferences; attribution can be username, pseudonym, or “anonymous.”

Note: Private “Researcher Access” is not part of the initial launch. We are focusing on a single, clear feature: public opt‑in sharing to Hugging Face.

## What is the “data flywheel” and why does it exist?

The flywheel is a simple feedback loop: people can choose to share selected chats, those contributions are reviewed and organized, and the resulting dataset helps evaluate and improve public AI. Using a Git-backed repository makes the process transparent: every contribution has history, discussion, and a clear license. The rationale is to create high-quality, accountable data for public benefit without asking you to learn a new workflow.

## I want the most privacy possible. How do I get that?

By default, we never share your chats, but we do perform aggregate analysis. For instance, we count the total volume of chat and how many users we have. We may also perform aggregate analyses of chat usage: how long are chats, what are common topics, etc. 

If you want a high degree of privacy, you can use "temporary chats" or you can delete chats yourself at any time.

## I'm OK with sharing a little if it helps out with public AI. What are my options?

There are two ways to contribute beyond private use:

- Use the inference utility in default mode (non‑temporary): your activity contributes only to aggregate statistics that help operate and improve the service.
- Opt in per chat to contribute to a public repository. Most of this document covers this option. These chats will be public, but you can select a license and also set AI‑use preferences.

Note on future options: we are exploring a possible program for responsible, consented asset access using privacy‑preserving tools. If introduced, it would have a dedicated consent flow and clear safeguards. It is not part of the initial launch.

## What happens when I share a chat?

When you click the share action, the app shows a confirmation screen with exactly what will be shared and which settings apply. If you confirm, the system creates a single JSON record containing the conversation, light metadata about the model and usage, and your chosen license and AI preference signals. That record is submitted as a pull request to a HuggingFace dataset repository where it can be reviewed. If accepted, it becomes part of a public dataset with the same license and preference signals you selected.

## What is the difference between public sharing and everything else?

Public sharing publishes specific chats to a Hugging Face dataset under the license and AI‑use preferences you select. Everything else remains private to your account (aside from de‑identified aggregate metrics that help operate the service).

## What privacy protections are in place?

We aim for a balance between usefulness and care. The action warns you not to share confidential or private information and provides a preview before you confirm. Automated checks scan for common identifiers such as emails and financial numbers and can flag items for quarantine. Reviewers can request changes or reject contributions that seem risky. You can choose a pseudonym or “anonymous” for public attribution, and public releases display the attribution string but not your account id. Today the pseudonym is deterministic from your OpenWebUI account id (unsalted), so contributions under a pseudonym can be linked to each other over time. If you want the least linkability, choose “anonymous.”

No automated system can guarantee perfect redaction. If you are unsure, please edit the chat before sharing or decline to share. When in doubt, prefer synthetic or anonymized examples. If you want to retract data later on, we will help you do that, but we must warn you that because the data is public it may not be possible to delete any copies that exist.

## What data about me is stored?

For public contributions, the dataset includes the chat content, timestamps, model information, your selected license and AI preference signals, and the attribution string you chose. Internally, we store a random contribution id and, if you choose “pseudonym,” we derive a stable pseudonym from your OpenWebUI account id. We do not publish your account information.

## Who can see my data and where is it stored?

Public contributions live as pull requests and merged records in a Hugging Face dataset repository. Anyone can view merged public content and its history. Items under review are visible to reviewers and, where practical, to the public in PR form. Content that triggers a privacy concern (or any other concerns) may be quarantined for private review.

## Will my chat be used to train models?

That depends on the AI preference signals and license you choose. Preference signals such as `train-genai=n` express that you do not want a contribution used for training. Responsible users of the dataset should honor these signals and the license terms. Preference signals are not a technical barrier; they function as a clear, machine‑readable policy that downstream tools and institutions can enforce. We use them to keep evaluation‑only subsets separate from training sets.

Preset options (Content-Usage expressions with CC signals as exceptions):
- Training family:
  - `train-genai=n` (deny training)
  - `train-genai=n;exceptions=cc-cr` (deny training unless Credit)
  - `train-genai=n;exceptions=cc-cr-dc` (deny training unless Credit + Direct Contribution)
  - `train-genai=n;exceptions=cc-cr-ec` (deny training unless Credit + Ecosystem Contribution)
  - `train-genai=n;exceptions=cc-cr-op` (deny training unless Credit + Open)
- General AI use family:
  - `ai-use=n` (deny AI use)
  - `ai-use=n;exceptions=cc-cr` (deny AI use unless Credit)
  - `ai-use=n;exceptions=cc-cr-dc` (… unless Credit + Direct Contribution)
  - `ai-use=n;exceptions=cc-cr-ec` (… unless Credit + Ecosystem Contribution)
  - `ai-use=n;exceptions=cc-cr-op` (… unless Credit + Open)

Default preset: `train-genai=n;exceptions=cc-cr` (deny training unless Credit).

## How do licenses work here?

You choose a default license in the app (for example, CC0-1.0, CC-BY-4.0, or CC-BY-SA-4.0). That license is recorded with each contribution and governs how others can use it. If you want attribution when others use your content, choose a license that requires it. If you want the broadest possible reuse, choose a permissive option. You can change your default for future contributions at any time.

## Do you perform aggregate analysis of chats?

We may compute aggregate, de-identified statistics across chats to understand system performance, reliability, and safety. Examples include counts, rates, and broad trends. Aggregate analysis is designed to avoid re-identifying individuals and to inform product quality and operations.

If you prefer not to leave any record tied to your account, use temporary chats and avoid saving conversations. You can also delete individual chats and, at any time, delete your account.

## How can I fully opt out?

If you never want your content used in public datasets or internal research, do not enable sharing and do not enable Researcher Access. Use temporary chats so conversations are not saved to your account, or delete chats when you finish. You can delete your account at any time from account settings. Deleting your account removes account-linked data we control. It does not unpublish contributions that were previously made public under an open license.

## Can I change my mind after sharing?

You can withdraw future consent by turning off sharing and disabling Researcher Access. For items already submitted, comment on the pull request or contact support to request changes. Public contributions that have been merged and redistributed under an open license may continue to circulate outside our control; we will reflect removals in our canonical dataset and communicate changes downstream where possible.

## What are my choices for identity and credit?

You can publish under your username, a custom pseudonym, or “anonymous.” Public pages display the attribution string you chose. If you want credit linked to a third-party account, you can also submit directly from your own HuggingFace account by opening pull requests yourself.

## Why is the pseudonym deterministic?

A deterministic pseudonym creates a stable identity that lets you accrue credit over time without exposing your account id. It helps reviewers and researchers recognize consistent contributors, makes moderation and feedback easier, and enables simple deduplication and analytics. The tradeoff is linkability: contributions made under the same pseudonym can be connected to each other within this system. If you prefer the least linkability, choose “anonymous” instead of “pseudonym” for public attribution.

## What should I avoid sharing?

Do not submit private, confidential, or regulated information about yourself or others. Avoid personal identifiers, financial information, and any content you do not have the right to share under your chosen license. If a conversation requires private details, do not share it. Edit the content to remove sensitive parts or submit a synthetic example instead.

## How do I set or change my settings?

In OpenWebUI, open Controls (Functions), enable or disable sharing, choose your default license and AI preference signals, and set your attribution. You can also enable automatic feedback to streamline contributions. These settings apply to future shares and are restated on the confirmation screen for each contribution.

## How do I report a problem or request removal?

Open an issue or comment on the relevant pull request with a clear description, or contact support through the chat app. For urgent privacy concerns, say that in the subject so we can prioritize review and quarantine where needed.
