# Future Directions

This section sketches near-term areas to extend the book and its accompanying materials. Please open issues or PRs to propose additions.

Here are just a few ideas:

## Content Expansions
- Additional case studies: public-sector deployments, civic tech pilots, domain-specific flywheels (health, education, climate).
- Deeper methods chapters: data governance patterns, preference signals, evaluation protocols, and reproducibility practices.
- Community processes: contributor pathways, governance models, and decision-making templates.

## Tooling & Infrastructure
- Consent and data rights flows: prototypes and reusable modules for informed consent, redaction, and data lifecycle controls.
- Evaluation harness: standardized benchmarks, metrics, and reporting for public AI systems; guidance on dataset release strategies.
- Legal/policy pack: practical checklists, model terms, and jurisdictional notes for public AI programs.

## Roadmap & Calls for Contribution
- Identify gaps: add issues tagging “help wanted” for chapters, examples, and figures.
- Build examples: minimal, runnable demos tied to book sections.
- Iterate: refine structure in response to reader feedback and real deployments.
