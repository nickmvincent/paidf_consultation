# Public AI Data Flywheel (Consultation Stage)

This repo holds all the materials for:

- the Public AI Data Flywheel Book (will be a community project)
- an MVP public AI data flywheel code implementation via a single OpenWebUI Action that will be installed to the Inference Utility MVP
- the terms of service and privacy policy for the Inference Utility MVP
- the data FAQ that will be linked from the Inference Utility


This material will live in this repository during a consultation phase, to collect comments and critique from the community.

Eventually, this will be moved to an organizational repo and opened up to PRs from the community.

For now, please just use this repo to open Issues/Discussions (or feel free to share comments via other channels).
